Which set of your team’s sequences of steps did you identify as being the best? Why? 
We identified Sumit’s as being the best due to the instructions on how to get from this room 340 to the exit of Zach, as well as the concise details on how to get to Reed arena. In addition, the directions follow a route that is almost diagonal to Reed arena which will be the shortest path. The part that made Sumit’s directions better than the rest was the directions on how to navigate through ZACH to get to the street from the classroom.
In what ways were the sets of sequences that were produced different? 
Derek’s directions included the distance you needed to walk for each step while Sumit’s didn’t. Andrew’s directions were similar to Sumits, but didn’t include how to get from room 340 to the exit of Zach.
In what ways were the sets of sequences that were produced the same?
All the directions included accurate steps once you left Zach to get to Reed Arena. In addition, all of the sets of sequences used directions such as left and right to navigate through campus. Upon testing all of them on maps, we were able to get to Reed Arena for each.
Consider whether your choice of which of these would be the best set of instructions might change depending on the person following them.
If the person using the set of directions was very familiar with campus, they should be able to follow all of the directions very well. However, it may appear to be too complicated for them. They may benefit from more simpler directions such as “Leave Zach from the exit near Starbucks and go uphill”. On the other hand, for someone who has never set foot on campus before, they would probably benefit from landmarks in the directions. For example, mentioning large buildings such as Kyle Field, the MSC or the bell tower to guide them through campus towards Reed Arena. In addition, we should also consider variations in a person’s mobility. For example, for a person that gets around in a wheelchair or a person that is jogging, we must provide directions for them to stay safe and away from main roads. For those who get around on a bicycle however, we should guide them to bike paths and roads that support cyclists. In addition, we should guide them to an area of Reed Arena that will allow them to park their bicycles. The weather can also play a role in our set of directions. It would be a bad idea to navigate someone through the open when it’s raining. Rather, we should navigate through buildings and tunnels as much as possible to keep them from getting wet

This was a very open-ended question. What questions might you have asked to begin with in order to better know how your sequential steps should have been written?
To better understand how to give our directions, we must ask clarifying questions such as what mode of transportation is the person taking, what is the weather like outside, what is the traffic like around Reed Arena. For example, if someone is on a bicycle, we want to navigate them along bike routes and to an area where they can easily park their bicycles. For someone in a car, we’d want to navigate them through a route that is expected to have the least amount of traffic.
