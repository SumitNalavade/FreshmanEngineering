What about the speaker’s instructions worked well?
The speaker describing how and where to draw the line rather than just describing the shapes made the final shape more accurate. For example, rather than saying, “draw an upside down triangle”, saying “draw an upside down isosceles triangle in the middle of your paper” was much more descriptive and easier to understand. 

What about the speaker’s instructions was difficult to follow?
There were a couple times the speaker was using higher level terms that made me stop and think for a second before I was able to fully understand. For example, when the speaker said “draw a circle tangent to the rectangle you just drew”, I had to stop and think for a second what “tangent to the rectangle” actually meant.

If you had to repeat the activity, what would you do differently? 
If I were to repeat the activity, the speaker would use simpler terms that would make their directions more clear to listeners. In addition, the speaker would include more precise directions rather than just saying “draw two lines in the middle of the triangle.” There should be more details such as the length and direction of the lines.
